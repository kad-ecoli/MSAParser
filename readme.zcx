'''
utilities for parsing multiple sequence alignments

note that sequence identity and coverage are expressed in the scale of
zero to one, and NOT the same as percentage sequence identity and 
coverage percentage used by hhfilter.
'''

fasta2aln      # convert aligned fasta to PSICOV format alignment
fastaCov       # remove sequence fragments
realignMSA     # realign the second alignment to the first one, based on 
               # match state of the first alignment
rmRedundantSeq # remove redundant sequences and sequence fragments
               # rmRedundantSeq is more stringent than hhfilter in that
               # it calculates seqID of non-gapped positions instead of
               # for full query sequence length.
trimMSA        # remove positions > symfrac gaps to lower case
