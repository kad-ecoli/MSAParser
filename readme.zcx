'''
utilities for parsing multiple sequence alignments

note that sequence identity and coverage are expressed either in the scale
of zero to one, or, in the case where it is greater than 1, in percentage
sequence identity and percentage coverage.

fasta2aln        # convert aligned fasta to PSICOV format alignment
fastaCov         # remove sequence fragments
realignMSA       # realign the second alignment to the first one, based on
                 # match state of the first alignment
rmRedundantSeq   # remove redundant sequences and sequence fragments
                 # rmRedundantSeq is more stringent than hhfilter in that
                 # it calculates seqID of non-gapped positions instead of
                 # for full query sequence length.
trimMSA          # remove positions with too many gaps
cleanFastaHeader # simplify sequence name in fasta file
calNf            # calculate Nf using GREMLIN definition
